                The game is played on a 7 by 7 board. Each player starts with 2 pieces.<br>
                <br>
                In each turn a player can make the following moves to one of his pieces:
                <ul>
                    <li>JUMP: A piece can be moved to one of the four adjacent empty squares(Up, Down, Right, Left), leaving the initial square empty.</li>
                    <li>REPL: A piece can be replicated to one of the four diagonal squares(Top-right, Top-left, Bottom-right, Bottom-left).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Moving or replicating a piece to one of the four adjacent squares of opponent's piece will convert it.<br>
                Player's score is calculated based on the number of pieces on the board.
                The game will end when:
                <ul>
                    <li>All of the cells of the 7 by 7 board is filled.</li>
                    <li>One of the player runs out of moves. The empty squares will be filled with pieces of the other player.</li>
                    <li>After 200 moves the game will be forcefully ended. Player with the most pieces will be declared as winner.</li>
